## Code Editing Agent (`./code-editing-agent`)

This project contains a step-by-step implementation of a simple Go-based AI agent based on the article ["How to Build an Agent"](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) by Thorsten Ball.

**Purpose:** Demonstrates the core concepts of building an AI agent that interacts with a user via the terminal and uses the Anthropic API (Claude). Each major step from the article is isolated in its own runnable Go module within the `code-editing-agent/` subdirectories.

**Remote Repository:** [https://github.com/garywu/code-editing-agent](https://github.com/garywu/code-editing-agent)

See the `README.md` *inside* the `code-editing-agent` directory for detailed setup and usage instructions.
